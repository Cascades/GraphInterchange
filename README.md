# Graph Interchange - A library for bringing together graph representations

The aim of this library is to allow any node graph and any algorithm which operates on node graphs to pass through a simple unified interchange. This should allow a corpus of node graph algorithms to be built, agnostic of implementation, and used on any node graph implementation with ease.
